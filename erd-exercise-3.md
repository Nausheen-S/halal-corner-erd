# Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Exercise 3

If you remember [the afternoon pairing exercise](https://wdi-sg.github.io/gitbook-2019/04-databases/relational/erd.html) that you went through, we will be focusing on the *SECOND* part of it today.

# Connect the Relationships into a Diagram + Write Code

### We arrive at our McDonalds Outlet again!

Moving from [the morning exercise yesterday](./erd-exercise-3.md), we will be moving on to the next part to writing code!

1. Using the relationships you wrote down or the diagram drawn, write the SQL code in your `.sql` file for the `tables`.

2. Now you can write the SQL Query for getting the following
  - Number of Customers who like Rock burgers and Fish burgers
  - Number of Customers who changed from always getting Rock burgers to only Fish burgers
  - There has been a spread of a new virus in Rock burgers due to Ingredients from one Supplier - which are the customers affected?
  - Which is the most popular food?
  - What are the rankings of the top 10 food?
  - What is the profit for this month?

3. Further
  - You will have to add your own date field that contains data like January 2019, February 2019, March 2019
    - Number of Rock burgers sold between January 2019 and February 2019
    - Cost of the ingredients used to make Rock Burgers between February 2019 to March 2019
