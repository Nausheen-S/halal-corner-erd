# Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Exercise 2

If you remember [the afternoon pairing exercise](https://wdi-sg.github.io/gitbook-2019/04-databases/relational/erd.html) that you went through, we will be focusing on the first part of it.

# Think of the Relationships - Then Draw a Diagram

## We have a McDonalds Outlet Store next door to us

You are now the developer for our backend. We have written specifications for you.

But: Some of the important things are not listed as a specification - because that's how it is

Your goal is to complete Parts 1 to 3.

Suggestion:

* Think of tables
* Think of columns
* Think of relationships
* No need to write any SQL code for today


### Part 1

We want to enable Customers to be able to choose Food Items from The Menu to the Cart, which has many Food Items, then see the ones chosen, then checkout and pay.

There are Promotional Food Items that will appear on The Menu on Tuesday to Friday but disappear on Saturday to Monday.

### Part 2

At 6pm each day, the store has to be able to tell that their Ingredients are still sufficient for the food making until the next 6pm.

And we want to know when to order the ingredients again.

We want to show customers the amount of calories for each Food Item.

We buy Ingredients from many different Suppliers where some Suppliers sell us many different Ingredients and sometimes we switch to a cheaper Supplier to make more profit.

We also want to make sure that the store is able to make a profit and does not have any deficit for the sales in the month.

### Part 3

We want to be able to find out which Period has the most number of customers paying for our food.

We want to find out the most popular food.

We want to find out the ranking of the top 10 food.

We will have an advertisement for our long-time Rock burger next week and we want to find out the increase in sales due to the advertisement.

We want to find out the profit for the month.


### FURTHER

We want Customers to be able to make Custom Orders for each Food Item - like extra sauce.

We want to find out whether the people who like extra sauce in their burger also like to buy large french fries.

We want to find out which Suppliers are repeatedly overcharging us.

We now have 5 McDonalds outlets and we want to find out which McDonalds outlet is the best one.
